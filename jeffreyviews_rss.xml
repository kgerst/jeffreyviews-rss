      <title>Argylle</title>
      <link>https://www.jeffreyviews.com/post/argylle</link>
      <description>PG-13 2024 Action 2h 19mAfter months of seeing trailers for Henry Cavill and Dua Lipa dancing to David Bowie, I succumbed to the marketing that had been drilled into me and I saw Argylle. As I expected, it was not a great movie. It’s over-the-top, it’s campy, and not the slightest bit realistic. ...</description>

      <link>https://www.jeffreyviews.com/post/the-zone-of-interest</link>
      <description>PG-13 2023 War/Crime 1h 46mI had high hopes for The Zone of Interest. It’s a foreign film (it’s from Poland and German is the spoken language) but has broken into the U.S. market and has gotten some good buzz. Unfortunately, it did not hold my interest and I can’t recommend it. The Zone of Intere...</description>

      <description>2023 R Fantasy/Romance 1h 45mAll of Us Strangers is well-acted and is interesting on paper, but it is slow-paced.
